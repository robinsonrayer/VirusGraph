Day1:1234
Day2:123123
```
Now you need to enter values then it gives

> (1.723, 27388389)

## PredictCases
Choose 2 and enter GrowthFactor and LatestCase
also enter how many days need to calculate for graph
eg:
```
GrowthFactor:1.723
LatestCase:2738828
How many days to calculate:10
```
This will give the prediction also a graph
### Note: LatestCase and LastCase are same

## Both
It will execute the PredictCases and GrowthFactor
It asks the same as GrowthFactor but also include
